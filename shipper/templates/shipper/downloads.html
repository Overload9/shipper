      <ul>
          <li>Where are the downloads hosted?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>All downloads are hosted at SourceForge.
                Each download button will allow you to download the latest build for your device currently on SourceForge.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>If I click on a download, SourceForge says the build is not found. What is going on?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>SourceForge may take some time to process builds and make the build available.
              During this time, you might receive an error. If this happens, then please try again after a couple of moments.
              If you don't want to wait, go to the device downloads page and download the latest zip there. </li>
            <li>Additionally, we may simply not support your device at all.
                If this is the case, we are working hard to support more devices. Keep an eye out!</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Why is my device not in this list?</li>
          <ul>
            <li>This is a relatively new system and therefore we are in the process of migrating all of our maintainers here.
                Unfortunately, if your maintainer did not migrate yet, then you may not see your device here.
                For all devices we support, please go to our <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects {{ sourceforge_project_name }}">SourceForge page</a> for now.</li>
